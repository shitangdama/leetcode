We have an array k of first n ugly number. We only know, at the beginning, the first one, which is 1. Then

k[1] = min( k[0]x2, k[0]x3, k[0]x5). The answer is k[0]x2. So we move 2's pointer to 1. Then we test:

k[2] = min( k[1]x2, k[0]x3, k[0]x5). And so on. Be careful about the cases such as 6, in which we need to forward both pointers of 2 and 3.

x here is multiplication.
