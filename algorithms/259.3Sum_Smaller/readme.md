259. 3Sum Smaller
Given an array of n integers nums and a target, find the number of index triplets i, j, k with 0 <= i < j < k < n that satisfy the condition nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target.
For example, given nums = [-2, 0, 1, 3], and target = 2.
Return 2. Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:
[-2, 0, 1]
[-2, 0, 3]

Could you solve it in O(n2) runtime?
Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.
For example:
Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]], return true.
Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4]], return false.
Hint:
Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]], what should your return? Is this case a valid tree?
According to the definition of tree on Wikipedia: ¡°a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.¡±
Note: you can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.
