/*
281. Zigzag Iterator
Given two 1d vectors, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.
For example, given two 1d vectors:
v1 = [1, 2]
v2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]
By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6].
Follow up: What if you are given k 1d vectors? How well can your code be extended to such cases?
