291. Word Pattern II
Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.
Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty substring in str.
Examples
    pattern = abab, str = redblueredblue should return true.
    pattern = aaaa, str = asdasdasdasd should return true.
    pattern = aabb, str = xyzabcxzyabc should return false.
Notes
You may assume both pattern and str contains only lowercase letters.
